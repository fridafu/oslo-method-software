If you want to make modifications in the program, you should read this.


1 GENERAL
----------
The program starts with the main program GF2.f, which is a few line program starting to initialise by calling the subroutine GFINIT.F, and then goes in an infinit loop calling GFEXEX.F each time a command has been given. GFEXEC.F is really the routine you should look into, giving about 80 commands and the calls to various subroutines. Generally, each command corresponds to one subroutine. The subroutines are mostly within the file KELVIN.F. Other special things you find for displaying (DSPSP.F, DSPMAT.F and OUTLAY.F), CLEANUP.F, READWRITE.F and utilities.


2 SPECTRA
----------
Important COMMON blocks are:

      INTEGER XDIM,YDIM
      CHARACTER APP*4
      CHARACTER APP*4
      COMMON/Sp1Dim/MSPEC(2,0:8191),MAXCH
      COMMON/Sp2Dim/MAT(2,0:4095,0:511),APP(512),XDIM,YDIM
      COMMON/State/Istatus,ITYPE,IDEST,cal(2,2,2,3),Idim(2,2,2),fname(2,2),comm(2,2)
      CHARACTER fname*8,comm*60
    

MAT(2,0:4095,0:511) houses the two matrices of dimensions x=4096 and y=512.
XDIM, YDIM are dimensions (integer) of the destination or active matrix. 
Idim(2,2,2) houses the dimensions for all matrices and spectra.

Idim(i,j,k) means:
i=1 for matrices and i=2 for singles spectra
j=1 is first and j=2 is second matrix or spectrum
k=1 is x-axis and k=2 for y-axis (j=2 and k=2 is meaningless)

Thus, Idim(1,1,2) means dimension for
 					matrix type
					first matrix
					y-dimension

Idim(2,1,2) and Idim(2,2,2) are not used since spectra do not have y-dimension. The Idim matrix is updated through the CLEANUP routine after a successful MAMA-command.

The calibrations cal(2,2,2,3) follows the spectra through the various commands, and cal(i,j,k,l) means:
i=1 for matrices and i=2 for singles spectra
j=1 is first and j=2 is second matrix or spectrum
k=1 is calibration for x-axis and k=2 for y-axis (j=2 and k=2 is meaningless).
l=1 is a0, l=2 is a1, and l=3 is a2 for the eq. E = a0 + a1*ch + a2*ch*ch.

IDEST   	=destination and active spectrum or matrix (=1 or 2)
ISP       	=source spectrum, normally not asked for, since if IDEST=1, 
		 then ISP=2, and so on.
ITYPE           =1 for singles spectrum, =2 for a series of spectra na-1,
		 na-2, na-3,.. and =3 for matrix.
Istatus  	=1 if a READ() statement returns error. You have then 
		 answered with wrong type of parameter (integer instead of
		 real etc.)

MSPEC(2,0:8191) houses the two singles spectra with dimension of active spectrum MAXCH+1. The array SPEC(1:8192) houses the last singles spectrum, which has been operated on. By display and peakfit, the program works on SPEC. SPEC is updated with MSPEC(1 or 2,0:maxch) through CLEANUP after a successful command.


3 DISPLAY
---------
For the display subroutines DSPSP, DSPMAT and OUTLAY, the following parameters are important:
      INTEGER            IYAXIS,LDX,HDX,LDY,HDY,LDZ,HDZ,LOCH,HICH,LOCNT,HICNT
      COMMON/DISPLA/DISP,IYAXIS,LDX,HDX,LDY,HDY,LDZ,HDZ,LOCH,HICH,LOCNT,HICNT
      INTEGER XDIM,YDIM,Limit(0:15),Color(0:15)
      COMMON/AXIS/iCE,itext,UNITx,UNITy
      COMMON/REMEMBER/mlimit(0:15)
      CHARACTER UNITx*3,UNITy*3
      COMMON/DisType/Idistype,OLlow,OLhigh,OLlocnt,OLhicnt

LOCH,HICH and LOCNT,HICNT are lower and upper display limits for singles spectra.
The LDX,HDX, etc. are Low and High display markers on matrices. The limits are set by the DX, DY and DZ command. DY corresponds to the number of counts for singles spectra, and DZ has only meaning for matrices, and tells also about maximum counts. The markers are used as default in the display. The function Setmarker(ix,iy,iz) controls what is to be done with LDX,LDY, etc.:

        ix=0     no action, update and test that x-markers are valid
        ix=1     set full scale for x-marker according to dimension
        ix=2     autoscale according to counts in matrix or spectrum
        iy,iz    as above as for x-axis. iz active only for matrices

     ldx,hdx=    markers on x-axis for 2-dim plot
     ldy,hdy=    markers on y-axis for 2-dim plot
     ldz,hdz=    markers on z-axis for 2-dim plot
     loch,hich=  markers on x-axis for 1-dim spectrum
     locnt,hicnt=markers on y-axis for 1-dim spectrum

If the call : CALL SetMarker (1,1,1) is performed, then the boarders are reset to the full dimensions. If you use CALL Setmarker(2,2,2), then autoscale appear for all 3 (2) dimensions, and the program searches for the boarders where no more counts appear. The command DZ -1 let you put up manually detailed limits for the colours of the matrix display. 

IYAXIS gives linear (=1), sqrt (=2) and ln (=3) plots. Negative signs for these parameters gives the axis on the right side of the display.
 
IDisTyp =0 means that only one spectrum or matrix are displayed and CR (curse) can be used to obtain energies and number of counts. IF = 1 (OL, outlay) and =2 (many spectra or matrices are displayed), the CR do not give information. If =-3 it is the very first display of an empty matrix, and only axis are drawn in order to speed up the initialisation of the program.

iCE controls channel (=0) or energy (=1) display (default=channels with iCE=0).
itest puts on/off the filename and time in the upper right corner of the display (default=on with itest=1).

Limit and Color gives the colours drawn within count levels of matrices.
      Color(0)=COLORMAP(MOD(4-1,15)+1)    !pink
      Color(1)=0                          !white
c     Color(1)=COLORMAP(MOD(13-1,15)+1)   !light-green
      Color(2)=COLORMAP(MOD(3-1,15)+1)    !blue
      Color(3)=COLORMAP(MOD(7-1,15)+1)    !green
      Color(4)=COLORMAP(MOD(8-1,15)+1)    !yellow
      Color(5)=COLORMAP(MOD(10-1,15)+1)   !braun-orange
      Color(6)=COLORMAP(MOD(2-1,15)+1)    !red
      Color(7)=0                          !white


4 UNFOLDING
-----------
RDIM is dimension of response-matrix. A0 and A1 is calibration constants. IF RDIM=0, then no response matrix is made. The response matrix is a 3. matrix hidden for the user. It is called R(0:511,0:511) and is of real type. It can be accessed through the GR command (Get Response matrix).
