Install instructions for reduc on Mac OS X 10.5 or higher
Executable files and scripts should have chmod 755
Text files should have chmod 644  
E-mail: magne.guttormsen@fys.uio.no

1	Copy the /sirius folder to /Applications/sirius
 	(the reduc program is located at /Applications/sirius/reduc
	however, you need the /bin and /include directories of sirius)

2	Copy the X11 file Reduc to app-defaults directory:
	sudo cp Reduc /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Reduc
	in order to obtain the appropriate X-environment (GUI fonts, colors etc)

3	You need Open Motif:
	openmotif3 ver.2.2.2-5 x11 Official Implementation of OSF/Motif (2.2 exp)
	The window manager can be downloaded free from Fink

4	You need to allocate shared memory:
	4.1	Open terminal
	4.2	Look what you have of shared memory:
			sysctl -a | grep shm
			kern.exec: unknown type returned
			kern.sysv.shmall: 1024
			kern.sysv.shmseg: 8
			kern.sysv.shmmni: 32
			kern.sysv.shmmin: 1
			kern.sysv.shmmax: 4194304
			security.mac.sysvshm_enforce: 1
			security.mac.posixshm_enforce: 1

	4.3	Change default values for shared memory:
			You have only allocated 4 MB = 4194304 bytes of shared memory.
			In order to increase this, we create a new system file under
			the /etc directory. You need sudo to do this:
			sudo cp sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.conf
         		
	4.4	Restart the computer (you may need to restart 2 times)
	4.5	Test that you got 16 MB shared memory:
			sysctl -a | grep shm
			kern.exec: unknown type returned
			kern.sysv.shmall: 4096
			kern.sysv.shmseg: 50
			kern.sysv.shmmni: 64
			kern.sysv.shmmin: 1
			kern.sysv.shmmax: 16777216
			security.mac.sysvshm_enforce: 1
			security.mac.posixshm_enforce: 1

			Note that: shmmax = 4096 * shmall (needed on MacOSX) 

5       You need to increase the maximum allowed value of your stack size
	5.1	Type the allowed limit (default was 8 MB, now 64 MB), write in terminal:
			launchctl limit stack 67108864 67108864
			(a script executes the command: ulimit -s 65500 65500
			to set the stack size when you start reduc )
	5.2	Restart the computer

6       Byte swapping between Intel and PowerPC CPUs:
        If you have a PowerPC CPU (old Mac), you should swap the event data bytes by
        ((x&0xff000000)>>24)+((x&0x00ff0000)>>8)+((x&0x0000ff00)<<8)+((x&0x000000ff)<<24)
        This is done by removing the commenting of 4 statements at the end of read_disc.c

7	To recompile and build reduc:
	7.1	Go to /Applications/sirius/reduc/src
	7.2	Type: sh REMAKE.ALL	

8	To start reduc, do the following:
	8.1	Open an xterm window
	8.2	Use cd to enter the directory of your eventfiles, called file_0, file_1, file_2...
	8.3	Type: reduc
