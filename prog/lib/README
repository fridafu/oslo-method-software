in the /Applications/prog/rewr directory.

lev-162Dy is used for decay.f to
give the low-energy yrast levels with
Ex, I and Pi. Can be obtained from the file
filtered.lec

The directory masses is downloaded from

The rct7mas03_egidy file is sent
Rositsa from Egidy in June 2005, 
and contains pairing energies. To be
used to calculate rho(Bn), robin.f

The masses_cm2lab.txt contains
accurate atomic masses and is used by
Andreas to run inversed reaction program
called cm2lab.f
